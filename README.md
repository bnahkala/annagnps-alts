Scripts for running many AnnAGNPS models using separate input files. 

Scripts used to run 42 different land management scenarios for multiple prairie pothole models to assess their flood patterns over a 25-year simulation. All scenarios were built separately in csv format, and those csv files are looped via reference numbers. 

A script for running AnnAGNPS 11 year simulation while modifying fertilizer and k20 wetland nitrate decay rates in the model. This is the preliminary check to evaluate AnnAGNPS ability to model nutrient data, of which we have monitored samples from 2016-2018.
